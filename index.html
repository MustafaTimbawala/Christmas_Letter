    <p>
      I know that you might think that I am good with words but there are many times that I am truly at a loss of them because of you. 
      I know that I am quite vocal about the things I like about you, but after you sent me such a sweet and loving message how could 
      I not respond with my own for you. So I will break this message down into three parts. The first being what you are, the second 
      what you have done, and the third being what you mean to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you are: You are such a beautiful woman. Your eyes are so bright (I know I’ve told you this a million times) and expressive, 
      they pull me in stronger than gravity can keep me on this earth. They sparkle more than the stars in the night sky. Your smile is 
      absolutely radiant. Honestly, I feel like I should be wearing sunglasses to see it, because it is wayyy too bright. I love all your 
      cute hairstyles, you mix it up and yet you never managed to look anything short of being absolutely adorable. Your ass, hips and tummy, 
      well you know more than enough about what I think about them. I really don’t need to say it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you have done: From the kisses, to the baked goods, to the gifts really a better question is what have you not done. All of these 
      things from big to small, every single thing means more things to me than you could ever know. You have made it possible for me to feel 
      safe in my relationships again. You have allowed me to feel loved and appreciated. You have made me worthy of belonging to someone again. 
      You have done so much more for me than you could ever know, so from the bottom of my heart THANK YOU for just being you.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you mean to me: You mean not just the world to me, you mean the solar system, the galaxy, the universe. You mean so much to me, 
      I genuinely do not know how to put it into words. You are my precious, cute, funny, driven, smart, attentive, kind, caring, loving, 
      ambitious Patrieka. Thank you for coming into my life and I very much look forward to our future.
    </p>
